# Note: Production environment uses:
# - 3-20 replicas (with autoscaling)
# - LoadBalancer service (~$18/month cost)
# - Large resources (500m CPU, 512Mi memory)
# - Warn level logging
# - PodDisruptionBudget for high availability
# - Production-grade monitoring and alerting
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
# - Use specific image versions, never "latest"
# - Enable all monitoring and alerting
# - Review and approve all changes
# - Test in staging first
