### Guidelines

1. **Keep it practical**: Focus on hands-on, testable examples
2. **Test your changes**: Verify all commands work on a fresh cluster
3. **Follow the structure**: Match the style of existing modules
4. **Be beginner-friendly**: Explain concepts, don't assume knowledge
5. **Include validation**: Add steps to verify the exercise worked

### Module Structure

Each module should have:
```markdown
# Module Title

**Duration**: Estimated time
**Prerequisites**: What you need to know first
**Next Module**: Link to next module
